## New Compass behavior

The compass button has received updates that improve its functionality. These changes make the compass more accurate and easier to use, and help you navigate better.

[**Compass button**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map/#map-orientation-and-compass): 

- **Single tap**. Rotates the map orientation to the North in all orientations. Even if it rotates back in a second, such as in compass mode.
- **Double tap**. Switches map orientations. This previously worked with a single tap.
- **Long tap**. Opens a bottom sheet with a list of available orientations. This function remains unchanged.

## Search by Brand Names

We added search and filtering by Brands that present in POI data.

## Redesign Graphs

Elevation graphs have been revamped to eliminate overlapping labels:

## Total Track Statistics
