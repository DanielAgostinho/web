## New Compass behavior

The compass button has received updates that improve its functionality. These changes make the compass more accurate and easier to use, and help you navigate better.

[**Compass button**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map/#map-orientation-and-compass): 

- **Single tap**. Rotates the map orientation to the North in all orientations. Even if it rotates back in a second, such as in compass mode.
- **Double tap**. Switches map orientations. This previously worked with a single tap.
- **Long tap**. Opens a bottom sheet with a list of available orientations. This function remains unchanged.

## Search by Brand Names

We added search and filtering by Brands that present in POI data.

## Redesign Graphs

Elevation graphs have been revamped to eliminate overlapping labels:

## Total Track Statistics

## Updates for Map Mode Menu

Added the new [Map mode](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#map-mode). The map is displayed in light or dark theme according to the mode selected from the list of suggested ones.

## Grouped tags

POI's tag with any traslations have a single item on the [Context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu#details).

## Profile Appearance Redesign

The [appearance of profiles](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles#profile-appearance) has been improved to make them more interesting, recognizable, and usable. 

The update includes:
- New icon and color selection components.

  - **View angle**. Status: *Off*, &nbsp;*Resting position*, &nbsp;*Navigation position*, &nbsp;*Rest & navigation position*.  
  Displays of the cone-shaped area you are currently in.
  - **Location radius**. Status: *Off*, &nbsp;*Resting position*, &nbsp;*Navigation position*, &nbsp;*Rest & navigation position*.
