## What is

In OsmAnd, a 3D GPX track not only displays the route's elevation but also offers additional data visualization, including speed, altitude, slope, and heart rate. This comprehensive view helps users analyze their performance and better understand the dynamics of their route in a realistic 3D environment.

## Why Use 3D GPX Tracks

The 3D GPX tracks feature in OsmAnd provides significant advantages for hikers, cyclists, and outdoor enthusiasts by offering a more detailed and immersive view of their routes. For hikers, the 3D visualization of elevation changes helps in understanding the difficulty of the terrain, allowing better preparation for steep climbs or descents. Cyclists benefit from seeing slope and altitude variations, aiding in route selection and pacing strategies. Outdoor enthusiasts, in general, can use the 3D view to assess the overall terrain and make informed decisions, enhancing safety and enjoyment during their activities. By visualizing additional data like speed and heart rate, users can also analyze performance and adjust their efforts to meet their goals. This makes the 3D GPX tracks in OsmAnd a valuable tool for anyone looking to optimize their outdoor adventures.

The 3D GPX track appearance can be useful in the following cases:

- **Elevation Analysis**: For hiking, cycling, or any outdoor activity where elevation changes are significant, a 3D view helps users better understand the terrain.

**Trail Visualization**: Mountain biking, skiing, or other sports enthusiasts can see the difficulty and steepness of trails.

**Route Planning**: Helps users plan routes by visualizing inclines and declines, making it easier to assess the challenge of a path.

**Training and Performance Tracking**: Athletes can use 3D views to review their performance on various elevations, aiding in training adjustments.

**Scenic Visualization**: For tourism or scenic routes, a 3D view enhances the visualization experience, making it more engaging.

**Navigation**: For advanced navigation systems, 3D visualization provides a clearer understanding of the landscape, aiding decision-making.

## How to Access the 3D GPX Track Feature

To access the 3D GPX track feature in OsmAnd, you need to have the **paid version** of the app, as this is a Pro subscription. Once you’ve upgraded, you can activate the 3D GPX track view by importing your GPX file into OsmAnd. Navigate to the map settings, and enable the 3D visualization option under the GPX track settings. You can then select the specific data you want to visualize, such as altitude, speed, or heart rate, and adjust the perspective to view your track in 3D. This setup allows you to fully utilize the enhanced features, providing a richer and more detailed navigation experience.

1. *Visualize by Speed with 3D*. One common use case is utilizing 3D tracks to visualize speed variations. This allows you to pinpoint specific sections of the track where you slowed down or sped up. With Wall Color based on the Slope, you can also observe how the terrain, particularly hills and inclines, impacted your speed. This combination of speed and slope visualization provides a detailed understanding of performance throughout the activity.

2. *Visualize by Heart sensor with 3D Relief*. Another insightful application is combining heart rate sensor data with 3D relief maps. This allows you to map heart rate fluctuations directly onto the terrain, giving you a comprehensive view of how altitude changes may have influenced your physical effort. The 3D relief feature, which exaggerates the altitude, works independently from the 3D track view. Two vertical exaggeration parameters can be adjusted to better understand the correlation between heart rate and terrain elevation.

3. *Visualize Track height and Slope color line on a flat earth view*. When visualizing altitude data, using a flat earth view is recommended to avoid issues like GPS errors, which might cause sections of the track to appear underground. In this scenario, slope changes can be visualized separately along the track line, while Wall Color utilized to represent altitude. This method ensures that even with potential data inaccuracies, you still receive a clear and accurate visualization of slope and elevation.


## Conclusion

The 3D GPX track feature in OsmAnd offers a powerful way to visualize routes in a more realistic and informative manner. By incorporating elevation, speed, slope, and other data points into a 3D view, users gain a deeper understanding of the terrain and their performance, making it easier to plan and navigate routes effectively. Whether you’re a hiker, cyclist, or outdoor enthusiast, this feature enhances your experience, turning your maps into interactive tools that provide valuable insights and improve your overall journey.
